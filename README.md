# Horiseon Code Refractor

I have been tasked with modifying the starter code for Horiseon marketing agency website to make it more accessible for their users. Making the website more accessible for the end user will enable people with disabilities to access the website using a variety of assisitve technologies. This will also ensure that the site is optimized for search engines.

To complete this I will be
* Ensuring that Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
* Checking that the HTML elements follow a logical structure
* Providing all image and icon elements with accessible `alt` attributes
* Ensuring that all heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Ensuring title elements are concise and descriptive
